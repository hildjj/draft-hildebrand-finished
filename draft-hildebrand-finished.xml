<t>Describes a mechanism to mark an Internet-Draft as “finished”, removing the
“Expires” information and prohibiting further versions of that draft from
being published.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Sometimes, authors want to make a document available to the Internet community
that will have a long lifetime, but do not want to go through a full standards
review.  Now that the Internet-Draft repository does not remove drafts as they
expire, writing an Internet-Draft is a lightweight mechanism for publishing
such documents.</t>

<t>Today, if an author wants an Internet-Draft to appear unexpired, they have to
publish a new version at least once every six months.  For documents that are
“finished” (See <xref target="finished"/>), this document proposes that the draft be marked
in a way that is easily distinguishable from drafts that are still works in
progress.</t>

<t>There are several motivations for this capability:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The desire to publish stable documents that the Independent Stream Editor
is unwilling to publish as RFCs.</t>
  <t>The need to distinguish documents without consensus or review from the more
formal outputs of the Internet community.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="finished" title="What “finished” means">

<t>A “finished” draft is one where the author promises to publish no further
revisions of a document with the same name to the Internet-Draft repository.
Further inferences, customs, and best practices may evolve over time regarding
when to mark a draft as “finished”.</t>

<t>Documents that are “finished” are not different from other Internet-Drafts in
that they do not represent the consensus of any portion of the Internet
Community.  They might, at the option of a stream manager, be published as
RFCs using the normal mechanisms; however, trying to publish a “finished”
draft is likely to be frustrating since there is no easy way to capture the
changes to the document that come out of the consensus-forming process.</t>

<section anchor="updates-after-a-document-is-finished" title="Updates after a document is “finished”">

<t>If for some reason an author does want to publish a new version of a
“finished” document, they will need to create a new draft with a new name.</t>

<t>Note to authors: (TODO: check on what happens to obsoleted I-Ds)</t>

</section>
<section anchor="review-process" title="Review process">

<t>Like all publications of Internet-Drafts, there is no review process before
publication other than mechanical nit checking.  The author uses
this mechanism at their own risk.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="changes" title="Changes to “finished” drafts">

<t>The following changes are made to an Internet-Draft when it is “finished”:</t>

<section anchor="naming" title="Naming">

<t>The naming scheme for Internet-Drafts is usually <spanx style="verb">draft-*-[dd]</spanx>, where <spanx style="verb">[dd]</spanx>
is a zero-padded number with at least two digits.  A “finished” draft will
be published with a name in the form <spanx style="verb">draft-*-fin</spanx>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="expiry-date" title="Expiry date">

<t>The finished output will not include an expiry date.  The expiry date would
otherwise occur:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>In the document header information</t>
  <t>At the bottom of each page of the text output</t>
  <t>In the “Status of this memo” section</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="boilerplate" title="Boilerplate">

<t>The “Status of this memo” section usually contains the following paragraph:</t>

<t><spanx style="verb">
  Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and
  may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is
  inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them
  other than as "work in progress."
</spanx></t>

<t>This boilerplate may be replaced with a new paragraph that says:</t>

<t><spanx style="verb">
  Internet-Drafts are draft documents do not represent the consensus of any
  community, but are the sole opinion of the authors. It is inappropriate to
  use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them
  other than as "work in progress."
</spanx></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="citation" title="Citation">

<t>(Note: I don’t know what to do with citations yet.  “Work In Progress” doesn’t
seem quite right)</t>

</section>
<section anchor="workflow" title="Suggested workflow">

<t>Frequently authors will publish several versions of a document before declaring
it “finished”.  Before marking an Internet-Draft as “finished”, authors should
seek editorial review from wherever they can get it.  Before abandoning hope
of getting a document published through one of the Internet community’s
other processes, the authors should have a conversation with a relevant Area
Director, working group chair, research group chair, or IAB member to consider
potential options.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="tooling" title="Required tooling changes">

<t>Several tools will need to be updated to support marking drafts as “finished”.</t>

<section anchor="draft-generation-tools" title="Draft generation tools">

<t>Tools such as xml2rfc will need to support the changes from <xref target="changes"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="internet-draft-submission-tool" title="Internet-Draft submission tool">

<t>The tooling that accepts Internet-Draft submissions will need to be made aware
of “finished” drafts.  This tool may use the published file name as an
indicator that the author wants to publish a finished document.  Further
prompts may be added to ensure that the author has performed a full review,
that the author understands no further versions can be published, etc.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="nit-checking" title="Nit checking">

<t>The nit checker will need to know about “finished” drafts in order to check
the changes mentioned in <xref target="changes"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="citation-library" title="Citation library">

<t>The library of citation XML may need to have slightly different XML created
for “finished” drafts.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">

<t>Authors of “finished” drafts, particularly those that deal with network
protocols, crypto streams, or other technical output, should consider the
consequences of security issues being found in their documents at a later
time.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iana-considerations" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>Drafts that are marked as “finished” are not different from other
Internet-Drafts with respect to registries that require “standards action”
or are “specification required”.</t>
